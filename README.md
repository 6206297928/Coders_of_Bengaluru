# 👨‍💻 Coders of Bengaluru

A Python project built **without any external libraries** (no NumPy, Pandas, etc.), focusing on **data collection, cleaning, structuring, and friend suggestion generation** from JSON data.

## 📖 Project Overview
The project simulates a **mini social network** where user data is:
- 📥 **Collected** from raw JSON files.  
- 🧹 **Cleaned** to remove duplicates or invalid entries.  
- 📂 **Structured** into usable Python data formats (lists, dictionaries, sets).  
- 🤝 **Processed** to generate **friend suggestions** based on shared attributes like location, interests, or mutual friends.  

This project highlights how far you can go with **pure Python**: file handling, JSON manipulation, data structures, loops, and conditionals — without relying on heavy libraries.

## 🚀 Features
- Raw **JSON data parsing** using Python's built-in `json` module.  
- **Data cleaning**: removes invalid/duplicate records.  
- **Data structuring**: organizes records into usable formats.
